## Course Overview
TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that makes development smoother, safer, and helps you catch errors and avoid bugs early on. TypeScript adds a bunch of useful features to the JavaScript that you know and love. It helps you be a more productive developer and forces you to write better code.

Happy coding!
